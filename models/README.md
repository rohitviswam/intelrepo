### This project has been created in two ways that is using OpenVINO Optimisation and using a pre-trained yolov3 model

### Yolov3 Model :
#### Github usually doesn't support files larger than 25 Mb.You can find the yolo weights in [My google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qkxZ8mKO0vqnagxGxIa5UKR0q1QaPbw0/view?usp=drivesdk) 
* Download it & move to yolo-coco folder

### OpenVINO Model :
#### The Path to the OpenVINO Model is in [My GitHub](https://github.com/rohitviswam/Intel_unnati_Social-Distancing/tree/main/Optimised%20Project/model/person-detection-0202/FP16-INT8). The Model Used is person-detection-0202 from OpenVINO.
